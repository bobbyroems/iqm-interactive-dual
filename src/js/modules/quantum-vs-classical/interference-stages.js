/*
 * Staged sequencing for Interference.
 *
 * The scene is ours; this is the order it is revealed in. Rather than opening with
 * five buoys and free tapping, the field arrives a piece at a time:
 *
 *   1. one buoy above water, prompted        -> tap
 *   2. wave lesson 1                         -> tap anywhere
 *   3. a second buoy rises, prompted         -> tap
 *   4. constructive-interference lesson      -> tap anywhere
 *   5. destructive-interference lesson       -> tap anywhere
 *   6. the rest of the field rises; each remaining buoy is highlighted in turn
 *   7. resolving — the flags settle and the finale line lands
 *
 * Kept free of DOM and three so the whole order is testable: the game asks it what
 * is revealed, what the current target is and which prompt belongs on screen, and
 * it never reaches back.
