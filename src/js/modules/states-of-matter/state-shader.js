/*
 * Full-screen screen-shader for States of Matter: frost, then rain, then steam,
 * composited over the scrub video.
 *
 * The water pass is a port of the Codrops "Rain & Water Effect Experiments" by
 * Lucas Bebber (2015) — https://github.com/codrops/RainEffect, src/shaders/
 * water.frag. Licence: "Integrate or build upon it for free in your personal or
 * commercial projects. Don't republish, redistribute or sell as-is."
 * https://tympanus.net/codrops/licensing/
 *
 * The three steps the module is specified around:
 *
 *   1. frost dynamically builds on the screen
 *   2. condensation forms as the ice melts
 *   3. fog makes things behind it blurry
 *
 * Step 1 is a port of Andrea Riccardi's FreezePostProcess — the shader behind
 * the 80.lv "freezing screen shader" article:
 *   https://github.com/a-riccardi/shader-toy
 *     ShaderToy/Assets/FreezePostProcess/Shaders/Git/FreezePostProcess.shader
 * It is per-pixel, driven by deterministic field textures baked from
 * state-fields.js by scripts/generate-som-frost-assets.mjs, and includes Inigo
 * Quilez's non-uniform tiling so the crystal map never repeats visibly. Frost was
 * briefly built out of stamped sprites the way the rain builds its drops; discrete
 * stamps read as blotches no matter how irregular the sprite, because frost is a
 * continuous field at every scale.
 *
 * Step 2 is the Codrops rain: a CPU-built normal map refracted per pixel.
 *
 * One deliberate departure from both originals: each composites an opaque
 * backdrop of its own, whereas this is a TRANSPARENT overlay. Steps 1 and 2 leave
 * the footage entirely untouched — no blur, no scale, no filter — and layer over
 * it. The rain original leans on a blurred backdrop to make each drop read as a
 * lens; with the footage pristine that job falls to the drops' own shading (the
 * fresnel rim and specular below), which this scene needs regardless, since a
 * smooth grey gradient gives a lens nothing to reveal.
 *
 * Step 3's blur is not in here. The fog blurs the video element itself (see
 * index.js), while this transparent canvas contributes the steam. The complete
 * treatment is contained by the media stacking context so module chrome remains
 * clear and interactive above it.

       a faded solid white on its own noise, banded close to the border.

       magnification resolves into straight-edged facets, and a tight contrast
       stretch on top of that amplifies those facet edges into visible straight

       opening fully frozen — so it moved here, to the step it actually belongs to.
